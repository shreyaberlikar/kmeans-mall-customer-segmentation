# 🛍️ K-Means – Mall Customer Segmentation

This project applies **K-Means clustering** to the Mall Customer dataset to group shoppers based on demographic and spending behavior. By clustering customers using features like annual income and spending score, the model uncovers distinct customer groups that enable targeted marketing, personalized services, and smarter business strategies.

## 🎯 Project Objective
Use unsupervised learning to:
- Discover hidden customer segments
- Analyze purchasing behaviors and spending patterns
- Support business decisions and customer retention
- Improve marketing personalization and resource allocation

## 👥 Dataset Overview
Typical dataset fields:
- **Age**
- **Gender** (if encoded)
- **Annual Income**
- **Spending Score**

> Replace or update based on the dataset you used.

## 🧠 Why K-Means?
K-Means clustering:
- Groups customers by similarity
- Helps reveal shopping personas
- Is fast, scalable, and easy to interpret
- Works well with numerical marketing data

Requires selecting a cluster count `k` — example: `k = 3`.

## 🧪 Implementation Steps
1. Load and inspect dataset  
2. Clean data and encode/scale features  
3. Create a KMeans model  
4. Fit on scaled data and assign cluster labels  
5. Explore and visualize results
